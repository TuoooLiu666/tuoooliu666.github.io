<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hello I'm **LT** (Tuo Liu). I'm a Ph.D. student at the University of Arizona, pursuing a degree in Environmental Health Sciences, complemented by a minor in Biostatistics. My research integrates omics technologies, advanced statistical methods, and environmental health principles to tackle complex public health challenges. Specifically:

- Omics technologies: Metabolomics & Proteomics
- Statistical techniques: Multilevel/Longitudinal Data Analysis, Machine Learning
- Environmental health: Evaluating the impact of environmental/occupational exposures on susceptible groups including Frontline and Essential Workers, i.e., firefighters, healthcare workers

I work as a Research Associate in both the Burgess Lab and the Furlong Lab, where I specialize in applying metabolomics and proteomics to understand the health risks from environmental/occupational exposures and enhance the health of vulnerable populations.
