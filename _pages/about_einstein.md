Hello I'm **LT** (Tuo Liu). I'm a Ph.D. student at the University of Arizona, pursuing a degree in Environmental Health Sciences, complemented by a minor in Biostatistics. My research integrates omics technologies, advanced statistical methods, and environmental health principles to tackle complex public health challenges. Specifically:

- Omics technologies: Metabolomics & Proteomics
- Statistical techniques: Multilevel/Longitudinal Data Analysis, Machine Learning
- Environmental health: Evaluating the impact of environmental/occupational exposures on susceptible groups including Frontline and Essential Workers, i.e., firefighters, healthcare workers

I work as a Research Associate in both the Burgess Lab and the Furlong Lab, where I specialize in applying metabolomics and proteomics to understand the health risks from environmental/occupational exposures and enhance the health of vulnerable populations.
